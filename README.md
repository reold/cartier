# Reold's Cartier Manager

**[Cartier Manager](https://reold.github.io/cartier) allows you to download and play music**. It is optimized for mobile devices such that anyone can listen to uninterrupted music, offline.

After sharing your _Spotify Profile Link_ with the app, you can quickly start to download all public playlists from your profile. After a playlist download is complete, you could either save it as an _.mp3_ or, save it to the browser's [OPFS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system). If you choose the latter, you gain the ability to play that particular playlist through Cartier Manager's Player.
